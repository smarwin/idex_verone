# Lean Electronic Lab Notebook

## Overview

This Lean Electronic GUI Lab Notebook `idex ver#one`is designed for inorganic chemists who need a streamlined and efficient way to document their experiments, observations, and research findings. Built with simplicity and usability in mind, it facilitates easy entry, retrieval, and sharing of lab data. All data stays with you, and you can easily search for past experiments, balance chemical equations, and calculate molar mass and sample weigh-in.

## Features

- **Digital Record Keeping:** Easily document experiment details, results, and notes.
- **Searchable Entries:** Quickly find past experiments with a robust search feature.
- **Balancing of Chemical Equations:** Automatically balance chemical equations.
- **Calculate Molar Mass:** Automatically calculate the molar mass of a chemical compound.
- **Calculate Sample Weigh-In:** Automatically calculate the weigh-in of a sample based on its Molar Mass and Equivalent.
